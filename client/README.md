# Software Engineering Portfolio for Xolani Victory

Greetings!! You are looking at the code I utilized to create my Software Engineering portfolio!! (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧

My name is Xolani Victory (nicknamed Lani), and I'm a Full Stack Software Engineer with an aesthetic eye and a penchant for Front-End Web Design. Using tools and frameworks including (but not limited to) HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React and Node, I'm using this website to not only showcase my projects but also my technical prowess. 

On this site, you will find a landing page, an "about me" section, a projects tab-- which showcases both web dev and non-dev related work I've done-- a CV page with a downloadable version of the file, and a contact tab to reach out to for work purposes. 

As you navigate my portfolio, I hope you enjoy the interactive experience and learn a bit about me not only as a developer but as a person as well. Thanks for stopping by!!
